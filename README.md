# David Azcona's Github

A repository for organizing my repositories, research and projects.

## Hackathons

1. [Prometheus](https://github.com/santiagxf/prometheus), [Web application](https://github.com/dazcona/prometheus), [Real-time detection](https://github.com/dazcona/real-time-prometheus). Combination of auto-piloted drones & Computer Vision to detect wildfires while they are still in their early stages. Trained a Deep Neural Network using transfer learning technologies & AlexNet, CUDA, Microsoft CNTK & Azure, Docker. Partnered with Arizona State University & Arizona Fire Department.
