# David Azcona's Github

A repository for organizing my repositories, research and projects.

## Research

1. [user2code2vec](https://github.com/dazcona/user2code2vec): Embeddings for Profiling Students Based on Distributional Representations of Source Code. Full research paper presented at Learning Analytics & Knowledge 2019 Conference in AZ, USA (LAK 2019)
2. [Irish Politics](https://github.com/dazcona/representation-learning): Learning representations in Irish Politics. I authored a publication on the increasingly popular [RTÃ‰ Brainstorm](https://www.rte.ie/eile/brainstorm/2018/0703/975980-heres-how-data-mining-can-offer-fresh-insights-on-irish-politics/) in collaboration with Dublin City University's School of Law and Government.
3. [Code Assistant](https://github.com/dazcona/code-assistant): Whatsapp Artificial Intelligence ChatBot to support learning of computer programming. Check it out and also its [proof of concept](https://github.com/dazcona/code-assistant-web).

2. [Huawei Celebrity Hunt](https://github.com/dazcona/insighters): Deep Learning Face Recognizer. Crawled the web for pictures, learned embeddings using CNN with CUDA and detected the celebrity using triplets & similarity learning. Huawei's Vision Challenge in Ireland: 4th place and 2nd fastest
3. BlindSpot AI: AI to help blind & visually-impaired people find objects using voice-activated phone scanning. Tensorflow & ImageNet Object Detection Android App. Special Mention award at Startup Weekend in Google Ireland.
4. [Sign2Text](https://github.com/dazcona/sign2text): Deep Learning and Computer Vision Sign Language real-time Translator to English using Drone technologies. Competed at 2018 Intel Atrovate AI Hackathon.
